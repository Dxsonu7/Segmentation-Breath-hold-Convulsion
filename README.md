# Segmentation-Breath-hold-Convulsion
I assisted Dr. Rajat Emanuel Singh, Assistant professor of Kinesiology at Northwestern College, in his summer research project. I wrote this Python program on Spyder IDE which helps to read data (breath-hold convulsion), segment using given parameters, time normalize (interpolate), and finally plot the interpolated data (graph) using Matplot library.
