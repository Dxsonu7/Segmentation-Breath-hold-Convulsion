This repository is dedicated to my summer 2022 research project: Involuntary breathing movement pattern recognition and
classification via force based sensors.The study recognizes/classifies phases of the involuntary breathing movement during breath-holding. I wrote Python scripts to manipulate data by segmenting, interpolating, and time normalizing, ensuring sucessful data visualizations and the publication of this research article.
